This is my favourite photo. 

Not because of the resolution, the composition, or any particular detail. It was taken on a Â£10 dumb phone with possibly the worst camera made in this millennium. It's because when I look at it, I'm taken back to a moment that I wanted to capture. It's separate almost all of the other photos I have. It's not just a pretty looking photo, or a memory I wanted to keep a hold of to be reminded, it's more than that - it was a feeling that I knew I wanted to keep.

I didn't take the photo because of a particular way the that person I was with looked (although she was very pretty, as it just so happens) or because I thought it would make a great photo (she was washing the dishes prior, after I made dinner, and then came and sat down), but because of how I felt in the moment I took it. It was that I felt warmth in my heart and wanted to have a reminder of that. I felt happiness looking at it, knowing that I had it. I'm glad I captured that moment, because now I have it forever. The feeling is a little lost, as happens with memories, but still there.

When we post hundreds of photos because of how they look, thinking about how they will be perceived to other people I think it's nice to be reminded that photography captures these small human instants which, from the outside, they may not mean much. But intrinsically, when we see it, it means the world to us.

I'm not with this girl anymore, unfortunately. But when I look at this picture, captured on a dumb phone I've now lost, for a little while I can remember that feeling, that moment, and that memory. And it also serves as a reminder; photography, as well as being an artform which has scientific complexities and nuances which I may forever be unaware of which is also, is a form of expression of capturing these little human moments we have. And these moments seem so few and far.

That memory and that warmth are dearly precious to me. More so than anything material I own.
